/**
 * The whole track context menu - the actions sheet plus the add-to-playlist dialog it opens - as
 * one composable a screen drops in.
 *
 * Every list that shows a song needs the identical wiring: four observed repository flows, the
 * key derivation, the queue calls, the dialog and its create-playlist branch. That was written out
 * once in Search and nowhere else, which is why long-pressing a row in Library, History, a playlist
 * or a collection sheet did nothing at all. Centralising it means a new action reaches all five
 * surfaces at once instead of being wired five times and forgotten in three.
 *
 * The screen owns only [track] - which row is selected - because that is the one piece of this
 * that is genuinely per-screen.
