 * rows are selected and the list those positions index, and every action, observed flow and
 * dialog branch lives here once. Renders nothing at all when the selection is empty, so a screen
 * can call it unconditionally.
 *
 * Every action clears the selection when it completes - a batch is a one-shot instruction, and
 * leaving rows ticked afterwards invites a double-apply. Add-to-playlist is the exception until
 * its dialog resolves, because this composable is what keeps that dialog on screen.
