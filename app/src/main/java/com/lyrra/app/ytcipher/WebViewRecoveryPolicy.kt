/**
 * Pure, clock-injectable backoff policy for a WebView-backed pipeline (cipher deobfuscation,
 * PoToken generation) that can start failing repeatedly - e.g. the WebView's render process gets
 * reclaimed under memory pressure. After [maxConsecutiveFailures] failures in a row, opens a
 * [cooldownMs] window during which [shouldAttempt] returns false, so the caller can fail fast
 * instead of paying the full WebView-creation cost again immediately, only to fail again.
 * [onSuccess] resets the failure count. Mirrors zemer-cipher's `RendererRecoveryPolicy`
 * (GPL-3.0, https://github.com/ZemerTeam/zemer-cipher) shape.
 *
 * Each WebView-backed pipeline should hold its own instance - a cipher failure and a PoToken
 * failure are independent problems with independent cooldowns, so one failing repeatedly
 * shouldn't also block attempts at the other.
