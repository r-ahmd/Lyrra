/**
 * Loudness normalization as a dynamic-range compressor, not a per-track precomputed gain.
 *
 * A real loudness-normalization feature (ReplayGain/EBU R128-style) needs a gain value computed
 * from analyzing each *whole* track in advance and stored somewhere - this app has no such
 * database and no offline analysis pass. What it can do honestly in real time is track a running
 * peak of the decoded signal and apply a smoothed gain that pulls loud passages down and quiet ones
 * up toward a target level - a soft AGC/compressor. That's what this does: same effect a listener
 * actually wants ("loud song, quiet song, similar volume without reaching for the slider"),
 * implemented as something that's actually true.
 *
 * Same [BaseAudioProcessor] pattern as [EqualizerAudioProcessor] - filters the decoded PCM inside
 * ExoPlayer's own pipeline rather than a platform `AudioEffect`, for the same device-compatibility
 * reason documented there.
