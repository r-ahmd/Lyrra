 * Multi-select bookkeeping, kept as pure set operations over **list positions**.
 *
 * Position rather than track identity on purpose. The app's own lists routinely contain the same
 * song twice - a phone's music folder holds duplicate files, a playlist can hold a track twice,
 * and a backend can return the same browseId twice - which is the same reason `LazyColumn` keys
 * here are positional (see the handoff's Compose notes). Selecting by `"title|artist"` would tick
 * both copies of a duplicate and would make "remove this one" ambiguous.
 *
 * The cost of positions is that they are only meaningful against the list that produced them, so a
 * screen must clear the selection whenever that list is re-ordered or swapped - which is why the
 * sort header is replaced by the selection bar rather than left live beside it.
