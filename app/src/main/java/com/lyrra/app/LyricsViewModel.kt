/**
 * Fetches lyrics for whatever is playing.
 *
 * Three providers are tried in order: LRCLib first (it returns real line-by-line LRC timing, which
 * is what makes a scrolling view possible), then BetterLyrics (word-level KRC timing), then
 * YouTube Music's own lyrics tab as a last resort - it has no timing at all, only plain text, so
 * it's worse than either synced source but still better than "no lyrics found". A provider that
 * returns [LyricsResult.NotFound] is not treated as a failure - the next one is simply tried, and
 * only a genuine miss from all of them surfaces as "no lyrics".
 *
 * Results are cached per track for the session, so scrolling in and out of the lyrics view or
 * pausing doesn't refetch.
