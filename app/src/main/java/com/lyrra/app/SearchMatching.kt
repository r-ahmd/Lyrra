 *   unrelated file buries the real match.
 * - YouTube Music's search (the same backend the official YouTube Music app itself uses) already
 *   does real relevance ranking, including matching a typed *lyric snippet* to the right song -
 *   something with essentially zero string overlap with that song's actual title, which our own
 *   title-similarity check would score near zero and wrongly discard. So YouTube's results are
 *   never filtered or re-scored by title similarity here; its own result order is trusted as-is.
 *   This is what makes "type a line you remember, not the song name" work at all.
 *
 * Final order: primarily by relevance (YouTube results always rank as maximally relevant, trusting
 * the source); ties broken by each source's own rank position (earlier = that engine's own higher
 * confidence), with YouTube winning a full tie.
