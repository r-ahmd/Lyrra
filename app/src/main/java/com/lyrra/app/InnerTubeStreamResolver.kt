/**
 * Resolves a YouTube videoId to a playable audio URL using **only** the ported `:innertube`
 * module - no part of Lyrra's own cipher/PoToken pipeline is involved.
 *
 * YouTube rejects most clients for most videos, and which client works varies per video, per
 * region, and over time - a single client is never enough. So this walks a fallback chain
 * (mirroring the order Echo-Music uses in its own `YTPlayerUtils`, which is a
 * tested-in-production ordering rather than a guess) and takes the first client whose
 * `playabilityStatus` comes back OK.
 *
 * If *every* client is rejected - typically `LOGIN_REQUIRED` - there's still one path left:
 * [YouTube.getNewPipeStreamUrls] runs the videoId through NewPipeExtractor, which does its own
 * independent extraction and signature deobfuscation and doesn't consult `playabilityStatus` at
 * all. That's the difference between "InnerTube can't play this" and "InnerTube can't play
 * anything".
