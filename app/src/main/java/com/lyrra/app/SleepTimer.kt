/**
 * A countdown that pauses playback when it reaches zero.
 *
 * A process-wide singleton with its own [CoroutineScope] - not [PlayerViewModel]'s
 * `viewModelScope] - because the timer has to keep counting whether or not a Now Playing screen is
 * currently attached to observe it; a ViewModel-scoped timer would die the moment the screen
 * backing it was torn down. Deliberately in-memory only, not persisted to disk: this app has no
 * background playback across a full process death, so a timer surviving one would have nothing
 * left to act on anyway.
