 * A syntactically-valid-but-fake HTTPS URL standing in for a YouTube track's real stream URL in
 * the playback queue. Using the IANA-reserved `.invalid` TLD (RFC 2606, guaranteed to fail real
 * DNS resolution) means [PlaybackService]'s `DefaultDataSource` still routes it through the
 * normal HTTP data source path (unlike a genuinely custom URI scheme, which `DefaultDataSource`
 * wouldn't know how to dispatch at all) - [PlaybackService]'s resolving wrapper then intercepts
 * it before any real network call happens and swaps in a freshly-resolved real URL.
 *
 * Shared between [PlayerViewModel] (which creates these placeholders) and [PlaybackService]
 * (which recognizes and resolves them) so the scheme/prefix lives in exactly one place.
