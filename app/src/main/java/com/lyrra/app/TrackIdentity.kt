 * Whether this result is backed by a real YouTube video id.
 *
 * Not every [TrackResult] is. Two produce a stand-in:
 * - a local file, which has no YouTube identity at all;
 * - a stored [Track] converted by `asTrackResult()`, which synthesises `"title|artist"` as the id
 *   when the row has no `sourceId` - *and* falls back to [MusicSource.YOUTUBE_MUSIC] for the
 *   source, so the source field alone cannot tell the two cases apart.
 *
 * Anything that turns the id into a URL or hands it to the API has to ask this first. Sharing a
 * fabricated id produces a dead link to `watch?v=Some Song|Some Artist`, and seeding radio with
 * one produces an error the user reads as "radio is broken".
