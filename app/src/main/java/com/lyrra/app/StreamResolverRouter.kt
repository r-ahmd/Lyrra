/**
 * The single place playback and downloads ask for a playable URL, so the [ExtractorBackend] chosen
 * in Settings governs the whole pipeline rather than just search.
 *
 * - [ExtractorBackend.INNERTUBE] resolves purely through [InnerTubeStreamResolver] (the ported
 *   module plus NewPipeExtractor). Lyrra's own cipher/PoToken pipeline is entirely out of the
 *   path.
 * - [ExtractorBackend.LEGACY] resolves through Lyrra's own [YouTubeStreamResolver].
 *
 * **Strict by design: there is no cross-backend fallback.** If the selected extractor can't resolve
 * a track, that's a playback failure rather than a silent hand-off to the other one. A fallback
 * would mask exactly the signal this switch exists to expose - whether the selected backend is
 * actually carrying playback on its own. Switching backends is a single tap in Settings, so a
 * genuinely broken extractor is cheap to escape from without hiding the breakage first.
