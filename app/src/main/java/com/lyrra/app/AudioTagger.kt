/**
 * Embeds cover art + title/artist/album metadata into a downloaded track's audio file, using
 * jaudiotagger (pure JVM, no NDK/native build needed - see the doc on [audioTagFileExtensionFor]
 * for why this app has no native module at all otherwise). Only ever called for a container
 * jaudiotagger actually supports (MP4/M4A, MP3) - see [audioTagFileExtensionFor].
 *
 * jaudiotagger identifies a file's format by its extension, not its content, so this works
 * against a temporary copy named with the right extension rather than [DownloadRepository]'s
 * actual `$key.audio` on-disk convention, then copies the tagged bytes back over the original -
 * every part of the app that reads a download's `filePath` keeps working unmodified. Fails
 * completely silently (logged, not thrown) on any error: a tagging failure must never break or
 * corrupt an otherwise-successful download, which is why the original file is only ever
 * overwritten after a tag write actually succeeds.
